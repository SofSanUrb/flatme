  <div class="section">
    <p class="mytext mb-4">Hi! We are Sofia & Marta, two passionate FullStack Developers, with the willingness to create something that will help others. After our experience abroad, moving to new countries where we didn't know anyone, we missed a platform where we could go and check reviews from other citizens, in order to have enough information to decide in which area of the city we wanted to move to.
    <br>
    <br>
    flatme is a platform that allows users to write district reviews, with the goal to create a community that supports each other providing relevant information about different areas and cities.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Would you like to help us grow up?</p>

        <p>Who doesn't love a good puzzle? That's how I feel about coding!
          I'm a developer and a building architect, specialized in Web Development, BIM Management and committed to ambitious projects with new challenges.
          My journey into programming began learning about the Revit API and Web Development, and from the first 'Hello World', I was hooked.

        <p>To live is to learn, that's my motto. I've always loved to learn new things and to put myself out of the comfort zone, trying to solve problems in the most creative way. A few years ago I opened for the first time freecodecamp.org, at got so impressed by how big and unknown to me this world was. Since then, I have not stopped learning.</p>
