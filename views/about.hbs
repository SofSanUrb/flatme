    <p class="mytext mb-4">Hi! We are Sofia & Marta, two passionate FullStack Developers, with the willing to create something that will help others. This project borns to cover a need we both had during our years abroad, where we moved to cities and countries we did not know before. During that experience we realized it was not easy to find a realiable source of information to understand the pros and cons of certain areas.
    <br>
    <br>
    flatme is a platform that allow users to write street and district reviews, with the goal to create a community that support each other providing relevant information about different areas and cities.

        <p>Who doesn't love a good puzzle? That's how I feel about coding!
          I'm a developer and a building architect, specialized in Web Development, BIM Management and committed to ambitious projects with new challenges.
          My journey into programming began learning about the Revit API and Web Development, and from the first 'Hello World', I was hooked.
          I am a better developer thanks to my career path in construction architecture, bringing into my code creativity to design and structure to problem-solving.2021 began with the perfect timing to participate in the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, looking forward for the next step in a Front End and Back End environment.

        <p>To live is to learn, that's my motto. I've always loved to learn new skills and to put myself out of the comfort zone, trying to solve problems in the most creative way. Few years ago I opened for the first time freecodecamp.org, at got so impressed by how big and unknown to me this world was. After much thinking, in the middle of 2020 I decided to undertake a Web Development bootcamp with Ironhack.</p>
